TODO: Save progress to localstorage.
TODO: Ability to input spanish characters.
TODO: Load initial app state from localstorage, if saved previously.
TODO: Add the verb "haber". One of the big three!
TODO: Stupid idea - make a turn-based, pokemon-style battle game out of this!



DONE: Add a 'finished' state with a results screen.
DONE: Plan for spaced repetition:
  - Each tense gets a queue of verb names
  - As a verb is completed, it is marked as correct or incorrect.
  - Correctly completed verbs go to the back of the queue, incorrect further
    to the front.
  - When picking the next verb for a task, always pick from the front of
    the queue.
